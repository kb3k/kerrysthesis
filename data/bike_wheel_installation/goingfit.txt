Reinstallation of the wheels is the reverse-engineered process of removing the wheels. You have to drape the run of the chain over the highest gear, which is the smallest one gear on the cassette.


Once done with the process you have to pull the wheel back into the dropouts, remember to bear in mind that at this point the wheel should be fully in the dropouts and the chain is squarely between the chainstays and the seat stays.


After the wheel is placed accurately between the chainstays and the seat stays you have to flip the quick release lever as you should be feeling resistance at the halfway point. Move the lever to the rear end of the bike as much as possible so it does not interfere with the riderâ€™s heel while in action.

After that close the quick release to move the brake pads closer to the rim. And there you have it your wheels are installed.
